## Access Ways

### Seeder File and Pre-entered Admin Data

To ensure the platform is ready for use after setup, a seeder file is included to pre-populate the database with an initial admin account. This allows for immediate access to the dashboard after the first-time deployment without manually entering credentials.

- **Admin Credentials:**
  - **Email:** `admin1@example.com`
  - **Password:** `password123`

- **Seeder File:**
  - The seeder script automatically inserts this admin user into the database when the project is set up. 
  - It ensures that there is at least one user with administrative privileges who can log in, manage the dashboard, and perform administrative functions such as adding or editing data.
  
- **Usage:**
  - After setting up the project, log in with the pre-entered admin credentials to access the full features of the dashboard, including the ability to export JSON data.
  
- **Security:**
  - It is strongly recommended to change the admin password upon the first login to ensure security.

- **Note:**
  - If anyone wants to retrieve the credentials of the admin user, they can check the seeder file for the pre-entered details.
